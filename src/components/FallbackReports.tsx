-- Users and Authentication
Users {
  id: UUID (Primary Key)
  email: VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE
  password_hash: VARCHAR(255)
  first_name: VARCHAR(100)
  last_name: VARCHAR(100)
  created_at: TIMESTAMP
  updated_at: TIMESTAMP
  is_active: BOOLEAN
}

-- Organizations/Tenants
Organizations {
  id: UUID (Primary Key)
  name: VARCHAR(255)
  domain: VARCHAR(255)
  subscription_plan: ENUM

  organization_id: UUID (Foreign Key)
  role: ENUM (admin, member, viewer)
  created_at: TIMESTAMP
}

-- Application-Specific Entities
[Domain-specific tables based on ${idea}]
```

#### Data Relationships
- **One-to-Many**: User → Sessions, Organization → Users
- **Many-to-Many**: Users ↔ Organizations (with roles)
- **Hierarchical**: Organization → Teams → Projects
- **Audit Trail**: All entities include created_at, updated_at, deleted_at

### Database Performance Optimization
```sql
-- Indexing Strategy
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_organizations_domain ON organizations(domain);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_orgs_composite ON user_organizations(user_id, organization_id);

-- Partitioning for Large Tables
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id BIGSERIAL,
  table_name VARCHAR(100),
  action VARCHAR(50),
  data JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);
```

## API Design

### RESTful API Structure
```
Base URL: https://api.${companyName.toLowerCase()}.com/v1

Authentication:
POST /auth/login
POST /auth/register
POST /auth/refresh
POST /auth/logout

User Management:
GET    /users/profile
PUT    /users/profile
POST   /users/invite
DELETE /users/{id}

Organization Management:
GET    /organizations
POST   /organizations
PUT    /organizations/{id}
DELETE /organizations/{id}

[Domain-specific endpoints for ${idea}]
```

### API Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response payload
  },
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "limit": 20,
      "total": 100,
      "pages": 5
    }
  },
  "errors": null
}
```

### Error Handling
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
      "message": "Invalid input provided",
      "field": "email",
      "details": "Email format is invalid"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
```javascript
// JWT Token Structure
{
  "sub": "user_id",
  "org": "organization_id",
  "role": "admin|member|viewer",
  "permissions": ["read:users", "write:projects"],
  "iat": 1234567890,
  "exp": 1234567890
}

// Role-Based Access Control
const permissions = {
  admin: ["*"],
  member: ["read:*", "write:own"],
  viewer: ["read:*"]
};
```

      scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"]
    }
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));
```

## Performance & Scalability

### Caching Strategy
```javascript
// Redis Caching Implementation
const cacheKey = `user:${userId}:profile`;
const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey);

if (cached) {
  return JSON.parse(cached);
}

const data = await database.user.findById(userId);
await redis.setex(cacheKey, 3600, JSON.stringify(data)); // 1 hour TTL
return data;
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Application Monitoring
```javascript
// Prometheus Metrics Integration
const prometheus = require('prom-client');

const httpRequestDuration = new prometheus.Histogram({
  name: 'http_request_duration_seconds',
  help: 'Duration of HTTP requests in seconds',
  labelNames: ['method', 'route', 'status']
});

const httpRequestsTotal = new prometheus.Counter({
  name: 'http_requests_total',
  help: 'Total number of HTTP requests',
  labelNames: ['method', 'route', 'status']
});
```

### Logging Strategy
```javascript
// Structured Logging with Winston
const winston = require('winston');

const logger = winston.createLogger({

## Interaction Design

### Micro-Interactions

#### Loading States
```css
/* Skeleton Loading */
.skeleton {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, #f0f0f0 25%, #e0e0e0 50%, #f0f0f0 75%);
  background-size: 200% 100%;
  animation: loading 1.5s infinite;
}

@keyframes loading {
  0% { background-position: 200% 0; }
  100% { background-position: -200% 0; }
}

/* Spinner Animation */
.spinner {
  border: 2px solid #f3f3f3;
  border-top: 2px solid var(--primary-blue);
  border-radius: 50%;
  width: 20px;
  height: 20px;
  animation: spin 1s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes spin {
  0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }
  100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
```

#### Hover Effects
```css
/* Button Hover */
.interactive-element {
  transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

.interactive-element:hover {
  transform: translateY(-1px);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}

/* Card Hover */
.card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: 0 8px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}
```

#### Success/Error Feedback
```css
/* Toast Notifications */
.toast {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  right: 20px;
  padding: var(--space-4) var(--space-6);
  border-radius: 6px;
  color: white;
  font-weight: var(--font-medium);
  animation: slideIn 0.3s ease-out;
}

.toast-success { background: var(--success); }
.toast-error { background: var(--error); }
.toast-warning { background: var(--warning); }

@keyframes slideIn {
  from { transform: translateX(100%); opacity: 0; }
  to { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; }
}
```

### Animation Guidelines

#### Performance Principles
- **Use CSS transforms**: Avoid animating layout properties
- **60fps Target**: Smooth animations at 60 frames per second
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Use will-change for complex animations
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect user preference for reduced motion

#### Animation Timing
```css
/* Easing Functions */
--ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1);
--ease-in: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1);

/* Duration Scale */
--duration-fast: 150ms;
--duration-normal: 250ms;
--duration-slow: 350ms;
```
